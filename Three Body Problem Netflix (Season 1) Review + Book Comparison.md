# Three Body Problem Netflix (Season 1) Review + Book Comparison

Hey guys, it’s Quinn here. If you appreciate my content consider hitting the Like button, still the only way the Youtube algorithm notices me.

This video will contain spoilers for Netflix's three body problem. Three body problem just released on Netflix, it is of course based on the book series The Remembrance Of The Earth's Past by Liu Cixin. And yes, based on the series because the first season doesn’t just cover the first book in the series The Three Body Problem, it moves into the second book The Dark Forest and even has scenes from the third book The Death’s End. It shows they are thinking about this as a series and they have every plan to continue the show. In fact, season 2 are already in the works what I hear. They had the task of establishing the essence the entire series, not just the first book. Now you guys know I am a huge fan of the book series and I've done several videos covering it on this channel. I definitely was apprehensive about this show because I am a big George.R.Martin fan, huge fan of the A Song Of Ice And Fire。And I didn’t really enjoy what the creators of its adaptation The Game Of Thrones did with the last several seasons of this show. When I heard they were the ones doing The Three Body Problem, I was nervous to say the least. But I willing to give it a chance, this series unlike A Song Of Ice And Fire is finished. So what did I think of the show? Is it a good show? Is it worth to watch? I will have to say it definitely worth to watch **unequivocally**, so it is absolutely worth to watch. It is a good science fiction, but how does it work as an adaption of the book? Well, let’s get into this.

One of the major criticisms about Liu Cixin’s series is the flatness of the characters. It’s a high concept science fiction book series, the characters are not the focus like really at all. I think the creators of this show were aware of this criticism and I think they did a good job of remedying it. Now I would say that the story in the Netflix show is actually very close to the book. So far, it absolutely **live within** the essence of the novel and even **improves upon** concern aspects in the book. The nature about Three body Problem game for instance, it makes a lot of sense in the show than it does in the book. And it makes a lot of sense that the game would be this advanced **sensory** technology rather than what essentially a VR headset and a VR suit in the book. I can pretty comfortably say that almost every major beat from the books is present in the show. You have the message from the trisolarans, the San-Ti as they called in this. This is not a change in name as some people have been saying, the San-Ti is actually called in the original Chinese version of the book. The translated version is the version that use the name Trisolarans, the San-Ti is actually more accurate. 

They also **get into** the Wallfacer Project, they get into the Stair-Case Project, the get into planetary defense AKA(as known as) the space force. It is **subtly** mentioned they get into **cryonics**, they get into the Sophon, they get into the interdimensionality of the universe, they get into the nano technology and it plays the same role that it does in the book. They get into Tianming’s fairy tales they set up. They get into the Dark Forest **hypothesis** and **deterrent** game theory they are both subtly **brushed upon** even for those that are paying attention, it’s all there. I have seen certain people say that the stories are unrecognizable or it might be unrecognizable if you only read the first book. But those of you that have read the entire series you know that they are setting up various aspects that occurred later in the series relatively accurate. 

What the difference start to occur is the characters. Many of the characters from all three books are **broken down** into several new characters. So any rumors about gender swapping or race swapping aren’t exactly true because they are mostly new characters. The thing is the original book is written in Chinese and almost the all the characters are Chinese, it is from a Chinese prospective. This is the western adaptation. There was a Chinese adaptation that was released last year that only covered the first book. But this is a western adaptation and changes were expected and that was never any secret. Also the story is not about characters necessarily it about humanity as a whole. So how significant are these characters changes really? Let’s get into it.

The character Wangmiao, for the first book, has broken down three different characters. You have Jack, Chengjin and Auggie Salazar. Wangmiao completely disappears and is never mentioned again after the first book. So the change kind of makes sense considering that these characters will continue on this series except for Jack, of course. And these characters will adopt certain characteristics of other book characters. And known as Da Shi, who is basically **intact** but he is not a Chinese by nationality in this, he is a British in nationality. And we have Ye Wenjie who is very similar to her book counterpart, her back story is almost identical. With some changes here and there but we will get into those a little bit later. And then there's Mike Evans, he is basically the same as he is in the book with some minor changes. And we have Thomas Wade who I found to be awesome in this show, a great adaptation for the book counterpart. Thomas Wade is the man that **gets stuff down** and for him **the ends justify the means**. And umm, we also have Chengjin who I mentioned earlier as having characteristics of Wangmiao, but she is mostly Chengxin. In fact there name is one letter off. you have Chengxin in the books and Chengjin in the series. And she is perhaps a bit of AA as well. And if you only read the first book again in the series you might not have recognized Chengjin as one of the central characters in this series she is absolutely Chengxin. Will is quite obviously Tianming and his connection to Chengjin is fully explored and expanded on, and it very close to the book counterparts. And I said for book readers, Tianming/Will's fairy tales are also set up. We see multiple times he is reading a book Fairy Tales and we see an image of paper boats floating on water, multiply times as well. These are scenes that only people that have read the later books will recognized. And that's along with Will/Tianming’s cancer, his purchasing of a star through The Stars Our Destination project, his cooperation of Stair-Case program which like in the book was led by Thomas Wade and worked on by Chengxin/Chengjin. All of it from the removal of his brain to the seeds being sent was from the books. It is very closed **narratively** speaking. I also predict that Auggie Salazar who has many characteristics of Wangmiao including nano-tech, scientist, including seeing the countdown will be given more characteristics of Chengxin and AA as well. There was something about the interaction with Chengjin and Auggie Salazar, that reminded me of the interactions betweens Chengxin and AA in the books. And Raj to me seems almost certainly to be Zhang Beihai. He is not fully **blossomed** into the character yet, but it seems pretty clear that that is what they are setting up. And that he is definitely fill the role of that character. And we have Saul Durand who has adopted the role held by Luo Ji in the books. The show moves pass the first book and Saul develops into basically Luo Ji from the books. We see his assassination attemps we see a version of his conversation with Ye Wenjie which is one of the most crucial scenes in the entire series. We see that he is elected as Wallfacer and like his book’s counterpart he rejects his role or attempts to. All of the major stories elements are set up.

All of these new characters are different from the book versions but they fulfill the roles of the book's counterparts pretty well in my opinion. The characters are interconnected. Emotionally you relate them all more than the characters in the book. Their interpersonal relationships don’t feel phoned in and their individual story lines never feel drawn out or **tedious**. And always work to further the narratives. Just think about it, in hours of content that I have made on the Three Body Problem series that you may have watched on this channel, how much of it do I spend talking about the characters or the **intricacies** of the relationships or interactions? Almost no time because the focus of the series is not the characters, it is the sci-fi, it focuses on the high concepts not the characters. The characters **take a back seat** in the book, characters are more important to TV shows and even the characters are changed the important connections that the characters that are necessary to the narrative like the connection between Tianming and Chengixn you know absolutely present in the show. But like I said the characters themselves have been reworked by including the new and reworked characters show adds more emotional weight to everything. For instance, in the book when Mike Evans’s ship is destroyed it just kind of happens and everyone moves on but in the show we see emotional toll of the loss of so much human lives, it really affects character Auggie Salazar. The scene itself is highly impactful in my opinion. And the way it shows how helpless Mike Evans and his followers are in the face of superior technology works. In my opinion as a prelude to certain events later in the book series which I will not spoil for those who have not read. But those of you who have read know exactly what I mean. 

Now though the story is very similar to the book, that are definitely some simplifications. For instance, they never quite get into the **factions** of ETO in fact they never say ETO Earth-Trisolar-Organization. Though ETO is very much present throughout this season.There are other simplifications as well. But nothing that in my opinion prevents you from understanding what is happening. And in fact I think that the streamlining of the narrative here actually works in favor of the show. The truth is a science fiction novel like I said can have elements that work great in novel form but in television form that samething might not works well. The show made a lot intelligent decisions in my opinion on what to alter. The show is made with understanding as well that the best part of the series are not the opening, not the first book. The events in The Dark Forest and The Death’s End are heart of the series. The show cleverly established the events of first book so that we can get to the events that actually define the series in a **well-paced** manner. 

Again, I am trying to say that all of these without spoiling the series but if you've read the books you know what I am talking about. Throughout the show we saw humanity works together to take on this problem just like the book, they developed new technologies to aid humanity through the war against Trisolarans.  The books are all about developing technology and the show is about the same thing. They even **go out of** their way to bring up the fact that development of technology will have severe limitations due to sophon interference. They all have to **hone in** on advancing the technology they already have as their higher forms of research were limited. This is the exact same **dilemma** that is present in the book.

There is an interesting thing that happens I think. I think that people expect wrong things from adaptations sometimes. So books are more easily adapted than others, some books need to be slightly different to fit the screen better. The Lord of The Rings is an example something that makes many changes from the original books and is still viewed as an amazing **franchise** because the heart of the books are still there even thougth several aspects changes and several aspects are even improved upon. And of course we have Stanley Kubrick's The Shining versus Steven King’s book The Shining famous **divergent** from the book yet the soul the book remains. I my opinion even with the changes of Netflix Three Body Problem makes it is far closer to the essense of the source material than most adaptations are. Now I am the higher critical of DND during the Game of Thrones era for being what I consider to be disrespectful to the source material. In my opinion, they have not done that here and believe me I would tell you if they did. The curious thing about this show is like the first book and the 1/3 of the second book, it just set up for the much larger events to come. This is the series that expands like no other. Dare I say I am **hyped** for season 2. What I really love is that I know for a fact that this show is going to get people who otherwise may not have been at all interested in reading the books to read them. The concepts are present in the show but I suspect that the curious mind who desire the finer details will seek out the book after watching it. 

Anyway I would say the favorite episode was episode 5. Very well done during my opinion I also thought the show had a very strong opening. Now I said I  would talk about some changes with Ye Wenjie. The huge **bulk** of the backstory is exactly the same. The only difference that is major is that her daughter is not Yangdong but instead the child of Ye Wenjie and Mike Evans who had a love **affair** back in the early days in ETO. This doesn’t affect the narrative really at all, it simply provides more connective tissue between the characters. 

As some of you may know last year the Chinese company Tencent released their adaptation of The Three Body Problem, it just cover the first book and it was 30 episodes long. The Tencent show which certain people seems to place on a **pedestal** had tons of additions, changers, emissions and it even had direct pop culture references like TikTok dances and a famous Chinese comedian was even present in a role that is not in the book and he also appeared in three body themed trailers that were present during airing of the show. It is not as fitful as an adaptation as people tend to pretend it is. Truthfully it has plenty of alterations. The big difference between Tencent version and Netflix version is that the changes of the Netflix version makes sense while what changes of the Tencent version left me scratch my head most of the time. And in my opinion, the Tencent version is too long and certainly far too long winded for a western audience. There were many irrelevant characters added and **repetitive** scenes that went on and on. But the most **egregious** problem with the Tencent adaptation is they fact they totally butchered the Ye Wenjie’s backstory in what seems to be, to me a **blatant** act of censorship on the part of perhaps the Chinese Government. The actual death of Ye Wenjie’s father as well as the cultural context surrounding it is fully omitted from the Tencent show. In contrast the Netflix show which opens the scenes exactly as the book does. And the scenes is very close to the book and very brutal. And this fact about Ye Wenjie, the fact of how her father died is key to Ye Wenjie’s throught process, is key to why she viewed the humanity the way she did. Cutting this is a huge mistake on the part of the Tencent show but I am glad this was not cut from the Netflix show.

David Benioff and D.B Weiss alongside Alexander Wood who I suspect is really keeping things together. Have done a much better job with this adaptation than I ever expected. Not because a DND’s, Game of Thrones **debacle**, because it is not an easy series to adapt effectively by any stretch of the imagination. Adaptation is hard, adapting a science fiction book that only science fiction book that only the science fiction fans are going to read into a show for the masses is an extremely difficult task especially while retaining the essence of the original thing. And they have done that here, I have to **give them props where props are due**. No television show is perfect but this is a good television show, it was worth to watch. And if it keeps the line of the books and then the second book is 10 times better. The show is not the book, but it is a good show.
