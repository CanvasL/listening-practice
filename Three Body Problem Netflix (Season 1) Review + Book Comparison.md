Hey guys, it’s Quinn here. If you appreciate my content consider hit the Like button, still the only way the Youtube algorithm notices me.

This video will contain spoilers for the Netflix three body problem. Three body problem just released on Netflix, it is off course based on series The Remembrance Of The Earth Past by Liu Cixin. And yes, based on the series because  the first season doesn’t just cover the first book in the series The Three Body Problem, it moves The Dark Forest the second book even some scenes from the Third book The Death’s End. It shows they are thinking about this ethic series in an everyone can plan to continue the show. In fact, season 2 are already in the work what I hear. They have a task of establishing the entire series, not just the first book. Now you guys know I am a huge fan of the book series and I have done several videos covering it on this channel. I definitely what apreahantes about this show because I am a big judge of Martin fans, huge fan of the A Song Of Ice And Fire。And I didn’t really enjoy what the creators of its adaptation The Game Of Thrones did with the last several seasons of this show. And I heard they were the ones do wins in The Three Body Problem, I was nervous to say the list. But I willing to give them a chance, the series unlike A Song Of Ice And Fire is finished. So what did I think of the show? Is it a good show? Is it worth to watch? I will have to say it definitely worth to watch on equivalent show absolutely worth to watch. It is a good science fiction, but how does it work as an adaption of the book? Well, let’s get into this.

The major criticism about Liu Cixin’s series is the flatness of characters. It’s a high concept science fiction book series, the characters are not the focus really at all. I think the creators of this show are aware of this criticism and they did a good job overwhelming it. Now I will say that the Netflix show is actually very close to the book. So far, it absolutely leave within the accents of now  we even approve to concern aspects in the book. The nature about Three body Problem game for instance, it makes a lot of sense in the show that it doesn’t in the book. And I made a lot of sense in the game would be the advanced centray technology rather than what essentially a VR headset and VR suit in the book. I can pretty confident to say that almost every major beat from the books is present in the show. You have the message from the trisolarians, the San-Ti as they called this. This is not the change of name some people like to say, the San-Ti is actually called in the original Chinese version of this book. The translated version  is the version that use the name Trisolarians, the San-Ti is actually more accurate. 

They also gave it into the Wallfacer Project, they getting into the Stair-Case Project, the getting into plentory AKA space force in sudden dimension, they getting into the Sophon, they getting into the Inter-dimensionality about the universe, they getting into the nano technology that plays the same role that does in the book. They getting into Tianming’s fairy tales that they set up. They getting into the Dark Forest highpothesis and the term of game theory are both satolly breshpont even for those that pay attention, it’s all there. I have seen certain people say that the stories are recognizable or might be recognizable if you only read the first book. But those if you read the entire series you know that they are setting up varies aspects that curve the ladder of the series are relatively accurate. What difference start the curve is the characters. Many of the characters from the all three books done into several new characters. So any rumors about gender swapping or race swapping aren’t exactly true because they are mostly new characters. The thing is the original book is written in Chinese and almost the all characters are Chinese, it is from a Chinese prospective. This is a western adaptation. There was a Chinese adaptation that was only covered the first book. But this is a western adaptation and change the world perspective and that was not any secret. Also the story is not about characters necessarily it about humanity as whole so how significant are the characters changes really? Let’s get into it.

The character Wangmiao, for the first book, has broken down three different characters. You have Jack, Chengjin and Auggie Stina. Wangmiao completely disappears and it never mention again after the first book so the change kindly make a sense this characters will continue on this series except for Jack, of course. And this character were adopt, certain characters are realistic of other book characters. And known as Da Shi, who is basically intact but he is not a Chinese by nationality in this, he is a British in nationality. And we have Ye Wenjie who is very similar to the book counter parts, her back story are mostly identical. With some changes here I will give it latter. And then Mike Evens, he is the basically the same as it in the book. And this is some minor changes. And we have Thomas Wade we will found he is awesome in the show, a great adaptation for the book corner part. Thomas Wade is the man that get the stuff down and for him it just found the means. And umm, we also have Chengjin who I mentioned earlier of having character realistic Wangmiao, but she is mostly Chengxin. In fact there name is one letter off. you have Chengxin in books and Chengjin in series. And she is composed AA as well. And if you only read the first book again in the series you won’t recognize the central characters in the series she is absolutely Chengxin. And Will is quite obviously Tianming, he is connection to Jin is fully explored and expand  it on, and it very close to the book counter parts. And I said for book readers, Tianming alias Will fairy tales are also set up. We see multiple times he is reading a book Fairy Tales and we see an image of paper boat floating on water, multiply times as well. These are scenes that the only people that have read the latter books were recognized. And that along with the Will alias Tianming’s cancer, his pretreating about the star and the star to the destination project, his coropnation of Stair-Case Program which like in the book would led by Thomas Wade work down Chengxin alias Chengjin. All of it from the move of his brain to the seats to be sent was from the books. It was very closed narratively speaking. I also predict that Auggie Stone who has many realistic Wangmiao including nano-tech, scientist, including seeing the count down would gave more the charastics of Chengxin and AA as well. It was something interaction with Chengxin/Jin and Auggie Stina, that remind me of the interaction between Chengxin and AA in the books. And rush for me to see the books certainly Zhang Beihai he is not fully brushed into the character yet, but seems pretty clear that what they are setting up. And that he is definitely fill the role of the character. And we have Saul Dilan who has adapted by the role helped by Luo Ji in the books. The show move pass the first book Saul develop basically Luo Ji from the books. We see the version of his conversation with Ye Wenjie which is mostly crucial things in entire series. We see that he elected as Wallfacer and like book’s counter part he is adjusted his role or tends to. All of the stories elements are set up.

All these characters are different from the book version but they fulfill the role of counter parts pretty well in my opinion. The characters are interconnected. Emotionally it related them all the characters in the book. Their interpersonal relationships don’t seem to find in and the individual story line isn’t find drone out. All ways to fill the narratives. Just think about it, in ours’ content that I have made on a series about Three Body Problem series that you may have watched in this channel, how much video we talking about the characters or the introvert of the relationships enduraactions? Almost no time because the focus about the series is not the characters, it is the sci-fi, it focus on a higher concepts not the characters. The characters take back seeds in the book, characters are more important in TV shows and even the characters are changed important connections, that the characters have and necessary to narrative the connection between Tianming and Chengixn you know absolutely present in the show. But like I said the characters themselves have been reworked including the new and reworked characters show as more emotional weight to everything. For instance, in the book Mike Evens’s ship is destroyed and it happens everyones’ move on but we see the show emotional toll of the lost so much human lives, it really affects character Auggie Stina. The scene itself is highly impact in my opinion. And the way it shows how helpless Mike Evens and his followers are in the face of superior technology works. In my opinion as a prelude to serve the ladder in the book series which I will not spoil for those who have not read. But those who have read knows what exactly what I mean. 

Now thought the series is very similar to the book, that are definitely some simplifications. For instance, they never quite get into the factions of ETO in facts they never say ETO Earth-Trisolar-Organizations. Those ETOs is very much present for out the season.There are other simplification as well. But nothing that in my opinion prevents you to understanding what is happening. And in fact I think that the stream lining of the narrative he actually acts favor of the show. The truth is the science fiction novel like I said can have elements that work on great level form but in television form that my something not works well. The show made a lot intelligent decisions in my opinion on water alter. The show is made it understanding well is the best part of the series are not the opening, not the first book. The events in The Dark Forest and The Death’s End are hard of the series. The show cleverly established it events of first book we can keep the events that actually find the series and well-paste winer. 

Again, I am trying to say that all of these without spoiling the series but if you read the books you know what I am talking about. Throughout the show we saw humanity works together to take on this problem just like the book, they developed new technologies to aid humanity through the war against Trisolarians.  The book is all about developing technology and show about the same thing. They even go out the way to bring the fact that developing technology will have the manipulation do to sophon into fearless. They all have to hold in and advancing the technology they already have as their higher form research are limited. This is exactly the same to learn about the presentation of the book.

There are some interesting things I think. I think that people expect wrong things about adaptations sometimes. So books are easier to adapt and others some books need to be slight different to fit the screen better. The Lord of The Rings is an example something that make many changes from the original books and still view that an amazing freches because the hard of the books. Still there are several aspects changes and several aspects are even improve to depart. And of course we have the outstanding shining versus Steven King’s books The Shining famous diversion of the book yet the soul the book remains. I my opinion even the changes of Netflix Three Body Problem makes it is far closer to the ancients of source material than most adaptations are. Now I am the higher * of the DND during the Game of Thrones to ever for me I am decided to be disrespectful to the source material. In my opinion, they have not done that to here and believe me I will tell you if they did. The accuracy of the show is like the first book and the fist episode of the second book, it just set up for the much larger events to come. This is the series that expands like know other. Like I say I high season 2. What I really love is that I know for fact that the show is going to give people who otherwise may not have all interested read the books to read them. The concepts are present in the show but I suspect that the curious mind to desire final detail to seek out the book after watching it. 

Anyway I would say the favorite episode was episode 5. During my opinion I also thought the show had a very strong opening. Now I will talk about some changes Ye Wenjie. The huge boss of the back story is exactly the same. The only difference is the major daughter is not Yangdong but in stand the child of Ye Wenjie is Mike Evens who have a lot of fire in the early days in ETO. This doesn’t really had at all, it simply provides more conductive tissue between the characters. Have some of you may know last year the Chinese company Tencent release their adaptation of The Three Body Problem, it just cover the first book and 30 episodes long. The Tencent show which certain people to think plays on a padesore had tons of additions, changers, amazons and even has direct pop culture references like TikTok dancers and a famous Chinese community media with even present a role is not in a book but also a pure a three body thing to trailer their present during the show. It is not fitful as an adaptation as people tend to pretend it is. Truthfully it has plenty of alterations. The big difference between Tencent version and Netflix version is that the changes of the Netflix version makes sense of what changes of the Tencent version let me scratching my head of the time. And in my opinion, the Tencent version is too long and certainly far too long winded for a western audience. There were many relevant, characters, edit and paradise scenes with on and on. But the most gorgeous problem is the Tencent version is they fact butcher the Ye Wenjie’s back story in what seems to be to me unblind to add censorship part of perhaps the Chinese Government. The actual death of Ye Wenjie’s father as well as the cultural contact surrounding it is fully omitted from the Tencent show. In contrast the Netflix show opens the scenes exactly as the book does. And the scenes is very close to the book and very brutal. And this fact about how Ye Wenjie’s father dead is heal to Ye Wenjie’s start process is he to why she knew the humanity the way she did. Cutting this is a huge mistake of the Tencent show but glad not cut from the Netflix show.

David and Danis along side with Wood, were suspected is really keeping things together. Have done a much better job with the adaptation than I ever expected. Not because a DND’s, Game of Thrones pop, it is not an easy series to adapt effectively by any starch of the imagination. Adaptation is hard, adapting a science fiction book is only the science fiction book that only the science fiction fans gonna read into a show full of messes is extremely difficult test especially we will returning the acents of the original thing. And they have done that here, I have to give them a props and props idea. No television show is perfect but this is a good television show, it was worth to watch. And it keeps the line of the book and the second book is 10 times better. The show is not the book, but it is a good show.

Thanks for watching guys. If you like and  Quinn’s idea, what do you think the Netflix Three Body Problem show?
