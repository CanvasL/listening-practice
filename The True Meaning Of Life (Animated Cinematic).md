# The True Meaning Of Life (Animated Cinematic)

Everyday over 150000 people died, that is over 6000 people every hour, over 100 every minute and about 2 people every single second. That means since you starting watching this video 20 people have already died. And some of these people got hit by cars, others fall out cliffs, others may had a heartache and others may from natural causes. Death is one of those things that every single living in Earth has in common. And death doesn not discriminate against your skin color or your political bullish or where you borned, how much money you have, no one can escape. 

In curable disease that we all a blast from birth called life. And it is interesting because even though we call logically know this very feel-vice heavily internal lifes. These how many views has valid set down with your eyes closed. And empty rooms are truly imaged what your federal look like. Like who even be at your federal, who be there with application and politeness and who will be there because they actually wanted to be there. Well, why would people sable you, why would they remember and it is weird because you think because we have this terminal disease called life that we all will be more sympathetic in loving with one or another. I mean that life disease is really the one thing that we all human beings have in common because in a one hundred twenty years from now, every single human being on Earth has be died and a brand new set of humans will be alive and then in another hundred twenty years after that another brand new set of people will be alive. And this is the cycle of life, just go and on and on.

And when you start thinking about life like this, you really start to realize how short our time in human Earth what it is. And you also start to realize that we all on this journey together as one. And it also makes you a question the way most people interact with one and another like why do so many people is so angry with each other or why do people argue with each other, why do people physically harm one and another, why these are so many parents yell at their kids or even beat their kids, why do so many _ who supposely love each other fight all the time, why the siblings wo don't speak to each other to this day over some disaggrement that took place years ago, why do best friends talk badly on each other behind each other's back, why do human beings behave like this? I think a part of these is because we really have not settle down to really think about the true meaning of life this and I also think that most people really have not come to terms with the fact they are not going to be here forever. And to be honest, I don't really plan to know what the true meaning of life is and I think something bad that our human beings can't fully logically understand. It will kind be like trying to explain c to a dog or a cat something. It just can't understand this. However, what I will say is the awesome things I think everyone should know. And I think the first actually understanding the topic The Meaning Of Life is first ally _ but the four truths of the Universe.

The first truth is the truth of cause and effect, which means that every single thing you do or say has some kind of effect on the world around you and yourself. For example, let's say a number years ago you lose your tempor and you get really mad at your loved one in your life it could be a family member or friend or even narrow random person on the street. That one single incident will you lost it has lingring a fact on that person to the state. Now with I have been said, it doesn't has some huge effect that you can be very miled and small effect could be very deep insert in subcautious. And this isn't neccessarily visible on an exterial that make mistakes. Effect is there and they will always be there and there is nothing you can do and do that. And the reason why most people hate _ is because it instantly make some accountable for every single thing they have ever done and been a head accountable that some people most human beings hate. To be clear, I am not saying we should all do well in the past and fee swearful for ourselves but does mean is that going forward you should be very cautious about the things you say and things you do in these words. And if you feel like you behave the way you really lost someone you could always appologize to that person because it is never ever to let him to say I am sorry.

And second truth of the Universe is impermanence, which means that every single human being on Earth is temporary like our bodies, our minds, our relationships even our brains even the video you are watching right now. This video were probably be gone one day because the sun could exploit and every single things could be gone in a second. And funny enough, it is actually a good thing and should not really make you feel bad or sad because it is not those things, but it should make you do is really cherish each every single moment that you have here on Earth. And to be clear, you don't have it to be a big special moments, they can be any moment like that one time when you left soul heart that tears fell from your eyes or maybe it was that time when you were simply sitting alone and you just gazing the sunset. Because all we really have in this life time is the present moment.

And Thrid truth is the suffering and attachment. And every time we could detached something or someone you basically make a contract with yourself to be unhappy because likely you discussed nothing here on Earth is permanent, which means you will eventually lose the loved one or you will eventually lose that watch or that car or that family member. Even your body you will going to lose.

And Fourth truth is that we all going to die one day. And the death truth is typically the toughest ones that most people to except because it after make people very sad. But death does not have be that horribly bad thing or even a sad thing. Because with old death the moments with our friends or family will not really be that special or deep. With soul death everything were eventually become daut and mik and grain and be no essentive to really love and cherished moments that we have with one and another. There would be innocentive to really live deeply, love deeply or even to be present. 

And these are the things that make truely life rich and worth living. And on top of these things, death is one of those things that truely does connect with all of us because it makes you realized that you and seven other billion people here on Earth are really whole on the same team because this is our time, this is our time to collectively live life the forest as one. So the next time that you feel need to yell at the loved one or to yell at that person you _ the traffic or to get a revenge the person who around you in the past. Just remember that you are choosing to actively hurt your very owned team mates. Make every moment _, love deeply, live deeply and be present in that moment because the end of the day all you realy have in life is the present moment. So don't let it go to waste.
